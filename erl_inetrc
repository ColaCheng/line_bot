%% on Openshift by default the DNS resolution of a service is ALWAYS the service global IP
%% The connection is routed to the local pod ip by IPTABLES on socket opening and is transparent to the application.
%% Conclusion DNS cache is important not to overload the server to resolve static service ips
%% Cache settings only applies if using :dns lookup, values are [native, files, dns]
{lookup, [file, dns, native]}.
%% Nb of entries in the DNS cache. Disable caching by setting 0. Default 100.
{cache_size, 1000}.
%% Time entries are in cache. Default 1h
{cache_refresh, 36000000}.
%% Lookup timeout in ms before retry. Default to 2 sec. Longer to avoid hammering the DNS server
{timeout, 4010}.
%% Lookup retries. Default to 3.
{retry, 3}.
